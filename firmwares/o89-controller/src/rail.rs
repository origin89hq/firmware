//! The module rail and its `EN` line, driven as `o89_core`'s sequencer says.
//!
//! Two pins, and the whole of the rule about them is elsewhere: `main`
//! applies the sequencer's boot lines before this task exists, so there is
//! no instant between the pins being taken and `EN` being held; the task
//! then asks the sequencer every 20 ms how the lines should be and writes
//! only what changed. `EN` is driven low or
//! released to the board's pull-up, never driven high, and never pulled up
//! by this part, because a pin held high into an unpowered module
//! back-powers it (F-003). The rail on revision A is on when driven high
//! and off when driven low; revision B's switch defaults on with the pin
//! high-impedance, and that mapping lands with its board.
//!
//! The ladder's recoveries come from the link task, which drops its UART
//! before asking so the lines into the module are inputs before the rail
//! goes (F-003); what the sequencer answered, and every settling of the
//! rail, go back to it as words on a bounded channel.
